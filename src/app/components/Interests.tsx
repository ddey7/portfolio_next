        <p>
          Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being
          outdoors. Love to travel to new places and explore and learn new
          things.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-0">
          When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre
          movies and television shows and I spend a large amount of my free time
          exploring the latest technology advancements in the front-end web
          development world.
